🌐 CoLab("flutterSdkVersion": "3.35.3"): Time-Zone Aware Team Collaboration App
📱 Learner Based Application
A Flutter-based collaboration platform designed to eliminate friction in virtual team settings by synchronizing time, communication, and project milestones across different time zones.

🚀 Vision & Objectives
The core aim is to facilitate seamless collaboration among virtual learners (like those in the Excelerate internship) by:

Eliminating Time Confusion: Providing a dynamic time-zone chart for easy meeting scheduling.

Centralizing Communication: Offering targeted sub-group chat functionalities to reduce reliance on external platforms.

Driving Delivery: Ensuring all members can easily meet project demands and deadlines through a global, centralized notice board for "deliverables."

Building a Scalable Foundation for future features like persistent media transfer and enhanced profile settings.
